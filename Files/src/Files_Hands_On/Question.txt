Java File I/O Problem Worksheet

Title: Log File Analyzer

Objective:

Build a Java application that reads a server log file, analyzes it, and generates a summary report.

Problem Description:

You are given a log file named:

server.log
Your Java program must perform the following tasks:

1. Read the file line by line.

2. Analyze the data:

Count the total number of log entries (lines).
Count the number of lines that contain the word "ERROR".
Count the number of lines that contain the word "WARNING".
3. Write the results to a new file named:

summary.txt
The report should be neatly formatted.

4. Handle exceptions:

If the input file is not found, print an error message.
If there is an I/O error during reading or writing, handle it gracefully.

Input File Example (server.log):

INFO Server started at 10:00AM
WARNING Disk space low
ERROR Failed to connect to database
INFO User login successful
ERROR Timeout occurred
Expected Output File (summary.txt):

Log Summary Report
-------------------
Total log entries: 5
ERROR entries: 2
WARNING entries: 1
Requirements:

Use BufferedReader or Files.readAllLines() for reading.
Use BufferedWriter, PrintWriter, or Files.write() for writing.
Use try-with-resources to ensure streams are properly closed.
Add meaningful comments in your code.
Bonus (Optional):

Also print the percentage of ERROR and WARNING lines in the report.
Allow the program to take the input and output file names as command-line arguments.
